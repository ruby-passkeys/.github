# Why?
Passkeys are a significant upgrade in security for both users and developers. The sooner they become industry standard, the better everyone will be.

However, to make that happen, there needs to be good, secure tooling. Our goal is to make that tooling for the Ruby ecosystem.


# Help needed
- **Maintainers desperately needed, particularly:**
	- Security researchers
	- People with experience writing devise gems
- Documentation for [warden-webauthn](https://github.com/ruby-passkeys/warden-webauthn)
- Documentation \+ tests for [devise-passkeys](https://github.com/ruby-passkeys/devise-passkeys)
- Registration & reauthentication helpers inside [devise-passkeys](https://github.com/ruby-passkeys/devise-passkeys)
- Security audit for gems
- Security-focused discussions on:
	- Account-recovery techniques
	- Emergency passkey registrations
	- Reauthentication logic
